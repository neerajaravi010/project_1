# Emotion Classification with Multiple Machine Learning Models
A comprehensive emotion classification project implementing and comparing various machine learning and deep learning models for text-based emotion recognition
## Project Overview
This project implements multiple state-of-the-art machine learning models to classify text into six different emotion categories: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise. The project provides a comparative analysis of different approaches including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models
## Dataset
The project uses three CSV files: 
1. training.csv - Training dataset
2. validation.csv - Validation dataset
3. test.csv - Test dataset
