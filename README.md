# Emotion Classification with Multiple Machine Learning Models
A comprehensive emotion classification project implementing and comparing various machine learning and deep learning models for text-based emotion recognition
## Project Overview
This project implements multiple state-of-the-art machine learning models to classify text into six different emotion categories: sadness, joy, love, anger, fear, and surprise. The project provides a comparative analysis of different approaches including traditional machine learning, deep learning, and transformer-based models
## Dataset
The project uses three CSV files:
training.csv
- Training dataset
validation.csv
- Validation dataset
test.csv
- Test dataset
